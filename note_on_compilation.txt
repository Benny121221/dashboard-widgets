	npm run-script build does two things:
	
	Executes the typescript compiler
		Compiled files are copied to the main directory
	
	Executes babel
		Compiles only .js and .jsx files, copying them to the main directory
		Copies all other files to the main directory (e.g. CSS files)

	ANY .js/.jsx FILE WITH THE SAME NAME (excluding file extension) AS A .ts/.tsx FILE WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
		Overwriting will be unceremonious and violent.
